    <h3>Steps</h3>

      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>In a bowl, season the shrimp with some salt, white pepper, and a drizzle of oil. Mix well and set it aside.</li>
          <li>In a separate bowl, season the rice with soy sauce, oyster sauce, dark soy sauce, and Sambal chili sauce.</li>
          <li>Crack 2 eggs into the rice mixture and mix well.</li>
          <li>Place a wok on the stove and turn the heat to high until smoking hot.</li>
          <li>Drizzle in some cooking oil into the hot wok and swirl it around.</li>
          <li>Add the shrimp. Stir for just a minute.</li>
          <li>Once the shrimp starts to turn pink, add the diced onion and garlic. Keep stirring until fragrant.</li>
          <li>Add the diced vegetables and stir for a few minutes or until cooked through.</li>
          <li>Remove the shrimp and vegetables from the wok into a clean bowl.</li>
          <li>Drizzle more oil into the wok and add the rice mixture. Stir over medium heat for a few minutes. The rice will be gluey in the beginning. As the egg starts solidifying, the grains will separate naturally.</li>
          <li>When the rice becomes fluffy, introduce the shrimp and the vegetables back into the wok.</li>
          <li>Give it a final toss for a minute letting the shrimp and vegetables heat through. Serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
